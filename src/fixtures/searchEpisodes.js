      description_original:
        'Full-stack JavaScript applications have been possible since the creation of NodeJS in 2009. Since then, the best practices for building and deploying these applications have steadily evolved with the technology. \nReactJS created consolidation around the view layer. The emergence of AWS Lambda created a new paradigm for backend execution. Serverless tools such as DynamoDB offer autoscaling abstractions. CDNs such as Cloudflare and Fastly can now do processing on the edge.\nBrian LeRoux is the founder of Begin.com, a hosting and deployment company built on serverless tools. He’s also the primary committer to Architect, a framework for defining applications to be deployed to serverless infrastructure. Brian joins the show to talk about his work in the JavaScript ecosystem and his vision for Begin.com.\nBrian is also speaking at Reactathon, a San Francisco JavaScript conference taking place March 30th and 31st in San Francisco. This week we will be interviewing speakers from Reactathon, and if you are interested in JavaScript and the React ecosystem then stay tuned, and if you hear something you like, you can check out the Reactathon conference in person.\nSponsorship inquiries: sponsor@softwareengineeringdaily.com\nThe post JavaScript Deployments with Brian LeRoux appeared first on Software Engineering Daily.',

Each of the panelists describes what they think JavaScript is, giving a definition for both technical and non-technical people. They talk about how the different layers of JavaScript tie into their definitions. They agree that it&rsquo;s incorrect to call JavaScript one of the &lsquo;easy&rsquo; programming languages and some of the challenges unique to JavaScript, such as the necessity of backwards compatibility and that it is used in tandem with CSS and HTML, which require a different thinking method. They discuss the disdain that some developers from other languages hold for JavaScript and where it stems from. They discuss methods to level up from beginner to mid level JavaScript programmer, which can be tricky because it is a rapidly evolving language. They revisit the original question, &ldquo;What is Java Script?&rdquo;, and talk about how their definition of JavaScript has changed after this discussion. They finish by talking about the story they want to tell with JavaScript, why they chose JavaScript, and what is it they are trying to do, create, become through using the language. They invite listeners to share their answers in the comments.&nbsp;\n\nLinks\n\n\n\t\n\tJQuery\n\t\n\t\n\tJavaScript\n\t\n\t\n\tJSON\n\t\n\t\n\tReact.js\n\t\n\n\nFollow DevChat on Facebook and Twitter\n\nPicks\n\nCharles Max Wood:\n\n\n\t\n\tThe Dungeoncast&nbsp;\n\t\n\n\nAimee Knight:\n\n\n\t\n\tThis Patch of Sky\n\t\n\n\nChristopher Beucheler:\n\n\n\t\n\tSilversun Pickups album Widow&rsquo;s Weeds\n\t\n\t\n\tAndrew Huang YouTube channel\n\t\n',

      description_original:
        'In this episode of JavaScript Jabber Charles Max Wood does interviews at RxJS Live. His first interview is with Hannah Howard at RxJS Live about her talk. Hannah is really enthusiastic about RxJS especially when it comes to frontend development. Her talk is about how to architect full-scale apps with RxJS. Hannah gives a brief summary of her talk. Charles having met Hanna previously at Code Beam asks her how functional programming and reactive programming work together in her mind. Hannah describes how she sees programming.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCharles&rsquo;s next interview is with Ben Lesh, a core team member of RxJS. Ben has been working on RxJS for the last four years. In his talk, he shares the future of RxJs, the timeline for versions 7 and 8. With Charles, he discusses his work on RxJS and the adoption of RxJS.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNext, Charles interviews Sam Julien and Kim Maida. They gave a talk together covering the common problems developers have when learning RxJS. In the talk, they share tips for those learning RxJS. Charles wonders what inspired them to give this talk. Both share experiences where they encouraged someone to use RxJS but the learning curve was to steep. They discuss the future of RxJS adoptions and resources.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFinally, Charles interviews Kim alone about her second talk about RxJS and state management. She explains to Charles that many state management libraries are built on RxJS and that it is possible to roll out your own state management solution with RxJS. They discuss why there are so many different state management libraries. Kim shares advice for those looking to roll out their own solutions.\n\nPanelists\n\n\n\t\n\tCharles Max Wood\n\t\n\n\nGuests\n\n\n\t\n\tHannah Howard\n\t\n\t\n\tBen Lesch\n\t\n\t\n\tSam Julien\n\t\n\t\n\tKim Maida\n\t\n\n\nSponsors\n\n\n\t\n\tABOUT YOU |&nbsp;aboutyou.com/apply\n\t\n\tSentry use the code &quot;devchat&quot; for 2 months free on Sentry&#39;s small plan\n\t\n\t&nbsp;\n\t\n\n\nLinks\n\n\n\t\n\thttps://www.rxjs.live/\n\t\n\t\n\tRxJS Live Youtube Channel\n\t\n\t\n\thttps://twitter.com/techgirlwonder\n\t\n\t\n\thttps://twitter.com/benlesh\n\t\n\t\n\thttp://www.samjulien.com/\n\t\n\t\n\thttps://twitter.com/samjulien\n\t\n\t\n\thttps://twitter.com/KimMaida\n\t\n\t\n\thttps://www.facebook.com/javascriptjabber\n\t\n\t\n\thttps://twitter.com/JSJabber\n\t\n',

        'JavaScript Jabber celebrates its 400th episode with former host Dave Smith and some other familiar voices. Each of the panelists talks about what they&rsquo;ve been up to. Dave hasn&rsquo;t been on the show for 3 years, but he and Jameson Dance have started a podcast called Soft Skills Engineering where they answer questions about the non-technical side of engineering. When he left the show he was the director of engineering on Hire View, and currently he works for Amazon on Alexa.&nbsp;\n\nChristopher Buecheler has been on several JSJ, RRU, and MJS episodes. His time is divided between contracting for startups and his own company closebrace.com, a tutorial and resource site for JavaScript developers.&nbsp; Dan Shapir has also been on JSJ as a guest, and is currently works for Wix doing performance tech. He enjoys speaking at conferences, such as JS Camp in Bucharest, Romania and the YGLF conference. Steve Edwards was previously on MJS 078. He started on Drupal in the PHP world, switched to JavaScript, and then a few years ago he started looking at Vue. Now he does Vue fulltime for ImageWare Systems.\n\nAs for Charles, his primary focus is the podcasts, since DevChat.tv produces around 20 episodes per week. 5 new shows were started in July, and he talks about some of the challenges that that brought. One of his most popular shows recently was JSJ 389: What makes a 10x Engineer? This helped him realize that he wants to help teach people how to be a successful engineer, so he&rsquo;s working on launching a new show about it.&nbsp;\n\nThe panelists share some of their favorite JSJ episodes. They discuss the tendency of JSJ to get early access to these fascinating people when the conversation was just beginning, such as the inventor of Redux Dan Abramov, before their rise to stardom. The talk about the rise in popularity of podcasting in general. They agree that even though JavaScript is evolving and changing quickly, it&rsquo;s still helpful to listen to old episodes.&nbsp;\n\nCharles talks about the influence JavaScript Jabber has had on other podcasts. It has spawned several spinoffs, including My JavaScript Story. He&rsquo;s had several hosts start their own DevChat.tv shows based off JavaScript Jabber, including Adventures in Angular and The DevEd Podcast. JavaScript Jabber has also been the inspiration for other podcasts that aren&rsquo;t part of DevChat.tv. There aren&rsquo;t many podcast companies that produce as many shows as they do and they&rsquo;re developing their own tools. DevChat.tv moved off of WordPress and is in the process of moving over to Podwrench. Charles talks about all the new shows that have been launched, and his view on &lsquo;competing&rsquo; podcasts. Charles is also considering doing an audio drama that happens in a programming office, so if you would like to write and/or voice that&nbsp; show, he invites you to contact him.&nbsp;\n\nThe show concludes with the panel talking about the projects they&rsquo;ve been working on that they want listeners to check out. Christopher invites listeners to check out closebrace.com. He also has plans to write a short ebook on unit testing with jest, considered doing his own podcast, and invites people to check out his fiction books on his website. Dan talks about his involvement with Wix, a drag and drop website service, that recently released a technology called Corvid which lets you write JS into the website you build with Wix.

        'In this episode of JavaScript Jabber Charles Max Wood continues interviewing speakers at RxJS Live. First, he interviews Mike Ryan and Sam Julien. They gave a talk about Groupby, a little known operator. They overview the common problems other mapping operators have and how Groupby addresses these problems. The discuss with Charles where these types of operators are most commonly used and use an analogy to explain the different mapping operators.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNext, Charles talks to Tracy Lee. Her talk defines and explains the top twenty operators people should use. In her talk, she shows real-world use cases and warns against gotchas. Tracy and Charles explain that you don&rsquo;t need to know all 60 operators, most people only need about 5-10 to function. She advises people to know the difference between the different types of operators. Tracy ends her interview by explaining her desire to inspire women and people of minority groups. She and Charles share their passion for diversity and giving everyone the chance to do what they love.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDean Radcliffe speaks with Charles next and discusses his talk about making React Forms reactive. They discuss binding observables in React and how Dean used this in his business. He shares how he got inspired for this talk and how he uses RxJS in his everyday work.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe final interview is with Joe Eames, CEO of Thinkster. Joe spoke about error handling. He explains how he struggled with this as did many others so he did a deep dive to find answers to share. In his talk, he covers what error handling is and what it is used for. Joe outlines where most people get lost when it comes to error handling. He also shares the three strategies used in error handling, Retry, Catch and Rethrow and, Catch and Replace. Charles shares his admiration for the Thinkster teaching approach. Joe explains what Thinkster is about and what makes them special.

        '...Today he has come over to <span class="ln-search-highlight">JavaScript</span> Jabber to talk about reactive programming and Storybook.',
      description_original:
        'Dean is a developer from Chicago and was previously on React Round Up 083. Today he has come over to JavaScript Jabber to talk about reactive programming and Storybook. Reactive programming is the opposite of imperative programming, where it will change exactly when needed instead of change only when told to. Reactivity existed long before React, and Dean talks about his history with reactive programming. He illustrates this difference by talking about Trello and Jira. In Trello, as you move cards from swimlane to another swimlane, everyone on the board sees those changes right away. In Jira,&nbsp; if you have 11 tabs open, and you update data in one tab, probably 10 of your tabs are stale now and you might have to refresh. Reactive programming is the difference between Trello and Jira.\n\nThe panel discusses why reactive JavaScript is not more widely used. People now tend to look for more focused tools to solve a particular part of the problem than an all in one tool like Meteor.js. Dean talks about the problems that Storybook solves. Storybook has hot reloading environments in frontend components, so you don&rsquo;t need the backend to run. Storybook also allows you to create a catalogue of UI states. JC and Dean talk about how Storybook could create opportunities for collaboration between engineers and designers. They discuss some causes of breakage that automation could help solve, such as styles not being applied properly and internationalization issues. Dean shares how to solve some network issues, such as having operators in RxJs. RxJs is useful for overlapping calls because it was built with cancelability from the beginning.&nbsp;\n\nDean talks about his tool Storybook Animate, which allows you to see what the user sees. Storybook is an actively updated product, and Dean talks about how to get started with it. The show concludes with&nbsp;Dean talking about some things coming down the pipe and how he is actively involved in looking for good general solutions to help people write bulletproof code.&nbsp;\n\nPanelists\n\n\n\t\n\tJC Hiatt\n\t\n\n\nWith special guest: Dean Radcliffe\n\nSponsors\n\n\n\t\n\tHasura, Inc.\n\t\n\t\n\tSentry use the code &ldquo;devchat&rdquo; for 2 months free on Sentry&rsquo;s small plan\n\t\n\t\n\tAdventures in Angular\n\t\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n&quot;The MaxCoders Guide to Finding Your Dream Developer Job&quot; by Charles Max Wood will be out on November 20th on Amazon. &nbsp;Get your copy on that date only for $1.\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nLinks\n\n\n\t\n\tRRU 083\n\t\n\t\n\tKnockout.js&nbsp;\n\t\n\t\n\tNode.js\n\t\n\t\n\tMeteor.js\n\t\n\t\n\tRXJS\n\t\n\t\n\tStorybook Animate\n\t\n\t\n\tRX Helper library\n\t\n\n\nFollow DevChatTV on Facebook and Twitter\n\nPicks\n\nJC Hiatt:\n\n\n\t\n\tJoker\n\t\n\t\n\tDevLifts\n\t\n\n\nDean Radcliffe:&nbsp;\n\n\n\t\n\tTwitter @deaniusol and Github @deanius\n\t\n\t\n\tThe Keyframers\n\t\n\t\n\tAction for Healthy Kids\n\t\n',

        '\nGoogle Search is a highly interactive JavaScript application. As you enter a query, results are being automatically suggested to you before you even finish typing. When you press enter, some of your search results may be widgets that represent the weather, the price of a stock, a recipe for green bean soup, or a language translation for a phrase. These complex frontend components are loading dynamically&#8211;the Google Search application cannot prefetch every single possible widget that you might ask for&#8211;but the results do load very quickly.\nGoogle has many other examples of advanced JavaScript engineering. The company is mostly known for backend engineering inventions like MapReduce, TensorFlow, Dremel, and Spanner. To turn these backend tools into user facing products, Google develops its own JavaScript frameworks and infrastructure to deliver information from the backend to the frontend.\n“Backend” and “frontend” are not precise terms. At Google, there are so many layers of infrastructure between a user and the data center. If you are an engineer working on a service at Google, you probably have several “frontends” and “backends” on either side of you.\nMalte Ubl is a senior staff engineer at Google. He’s heavily involved in Google’s JavaScript infrastructure, and has written about managing large JavaScript applications in detail. He also works on AMP, an open-source project for delivering web pages in a fast, performant format. He joins the show to describe Google’s history with JavaScript frameworks, the process of building frontends and middleware to deliver JavaScript applications, and the engineering behind AMP. There are criticisms of AMP, but some of them misunderstand how the AMP technology actually works.  AMP allows pages to be cached, prefetched, and served to a user more quickly. AMP does not necessarily centralize pages around being served from Google Search. A good example of AMP speeding up pages outside of Google is reddit.\nWe recently launched a new podcast: Fintech Daily!
